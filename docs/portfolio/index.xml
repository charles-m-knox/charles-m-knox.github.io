      <description>A booming, Etsy-based online retailer called BananAppeal.co was in need of a landing page, and I wanted to help them out. So, in less than one day, I assembled a simple (but very sleek) landing page for their business.
You can view the page here: bananappeal.co
Video Sorry, your browser doesn&#39;t support embedded videos.  Performance/Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO Using Lighthouse, the website meets almost 100% across every web-based metric:
The only metric it falls behind on is the recommendation to serve next-gen images instead of the more universally compatible jpg/png images.</description>

      <description>jsinvest and goinvest are two utilities I wrote that do the same thing: Help you balance your financial portfolio according to allocations that you can customize.
About the project This was written as a coding project, but also to serve a practical purpose to my every day life. I want to be able to spend, say, $1000 on a spread of financial ETFs/stocks - for example, 50% large-cap, 50% small-cap, etc.</description>

Preface Before talking about my addon directly, first I wanted to explain the context behind why it was created in the first place.
As a privacy enthusiast, I often find myself configuring my browser to match my needs.</description>

      <title>Professional Blog Site</title>

      <description>Before switching to Hugo, I wrote my own full-stack website, and hosted it on AWS. The site was written in:
 Frontend: Angular 9 Middleware/web server: Go 1.13 Data: Static markdown files  Screenshots Because the website is not statically generated and requires a live API, and I do not want to continue to provide uptime for the API, I&amp;rsquo;ll be providing a few screen captures of the site in action.</description>

      <title>Light Sites</title>

      <description>Light Sites is a Go-powered, no-JavaScript, template-friendly, lightweight markdown parser and server. It aims to combine Bootstrap CSS (and other customizable CSS if you choose) with Markdown with minimal configuration.
About the project This was written as a coding project. I wanted to create a minimalistic server to parse markdown files and manipulate them according to some essential customizations. It&amp;rsquo;s more of reference code than an actual production-ready solution. For the purposes of a proper website deployment, I recommend Hugo.</description>
