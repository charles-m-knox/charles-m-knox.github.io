      <description>ðŸ’‰ Introduction A friend of mine, Tynick, and I crossed paths on a project he started - he wanted to get a COVID vaccine by doing a volunteer shift. The two websites that offer volunteering signups occasionally had openings, but they were always taken almost immediately.
So, he had the brilliant idea to use some clever Python to automatically check the website, and notify him with Slack or Twilio whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a signup available.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s April 24, 2020. Ubuntu 20.04 just came out. Installing Docker via the method I typically use via get.docker.com does not seem to work. Additionally, the Docker website doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have install instructions for Ubuntu 20.04 yet. Snap installations are recommended by Canonical, but from past experience with the Docker Snap, I prefer to stick to a native method of installation.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have Ubuntu 20.04 yet, it was released on April 23, 2020.</description>
