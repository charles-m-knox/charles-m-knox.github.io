## Thank you to the community

What makes this release of Firefox Containers Helper special is that it has received some awesome community engagement! I really never thought that it would gain enough attention or usage from people around the world for people to create [GitHub issues](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/pulls), and become [supporters](https://charlesmknox.com/supporters/)

## New features added

* **Dark and Light mode** - [Bootstrap dark mode](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark) which respects your system theme preference
  * Note: On my Ubuntu system, changing Firefox's theme wasn't enough, I had to change my entire theme from a dark theme to a light theme to switch the preference
* **Select Mode** - Allows you to precisely select only a couple results from the list by first enabling the mode and then pressing `Ctrl+Click`, or multiple by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Click`
* **Configurable Keyboard Shortcut** - Allows you to change the keyboard shortcut for showing the extension popup window, which is by default `Alt+Shift+D`. This fixes [#4](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/4)
* **Container Quick-Add** - Allows you to quickly add a new container based on what you have typed into the filter text box. Defaults to a circle icon and the toolbar color

## Multi-selection mode live example

## Changes straight from the changelog

### v0.0.12-v0.0.14

* fix [#11](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/11), the indexing for multi-select was using the total number of containers instead of the filtered number of containers ðŸ˜°
* re-add "+" button for containers since it's actually fine
* added stern warning to the readme about NEVER disabling or deleting all of your container extensions in Firefox, or else they'll get completely reset

### v0.0.11

* dark mode and light mode added in [#8](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/pull/8)
  * Thanks to https://github.com/KerfuffleV2 for this contribution!
* configurable keyboard shortcut added (see [#4](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/4))
* adds *Select Mode*, as requested by the project's [first supporter](https://charlesmknox.com/supporters/#bob-haines)!
  * resolves [#6](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/6)
* fix [#9](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/firefox-containers-helper/issues/9)... no longer drops all casing to lowercase when using "replace in name" mode, sorry about that!
* "replace in name" used to be case-insensitive, but I believe it's better to have case-sensitive replacing
  * Please file an issue and talk with me if you disagree or believe there should be a better approach! Thank you! ðŸ™‚
* added a small "Donate" link to my personal site with my personal avatar, I appreciate your support everyone ðŸ™‚
* added a simple "+" button to quickly add a new container based on the user's current input, this was requested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/m0fvwy/the_multiaccount_containers_addon_is_awesome_but/gq8wqig?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

## Final note

I hope you enjoy the extension! It's been steadily growing in popularity and I am happy to see people using it.
