      <description>Go 1.16 was released - here are the release notes.
The thing that caught my eye was that io/ioutil has been deprecated - here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know
 The io/ioutil package has turned out to be a poorly defined and hard to understand collection of things. All functionality provided by the package has been moved to other packages. The io/ioutil package remains and will continue to work as before, but we encourage new code to use the new definitions in the io and os packages.</description>
