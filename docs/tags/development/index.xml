      <description>The title is a bit of an exaggeration, but it&amp;rsquo;s partly true if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the correct properties in your HTML elements.
In HTML, you should be using rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer&amp;quot; along with target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; in your &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tags - if not, you run major security risks. This GitHub Pages site shows you how: https://apal21.github.io/target-blank/
Many linters will catch this if it&amp;rsquo;s not set, so make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re using a linter when you write your code.</description>

      <title>Swagger and OpenAPI</title>

      <description>Swagger is a framework to enable arbitrary implementations of the OpenAPI specification.
Why? In all of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on (personal and professional), one of the more consistent problems is documentation of API endpoints, as well as agreement upon REST interaction schema between microservices. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a few years into my software development career that I became aware of Swagger.
Swagger lets you:
 auto-generate interactive documentation for your REST API auto-generate a client to consume your defined REST API in many programming languages/frameworks auto-generate a server to host your defined REST API in many programming languages/frameworks  For the bright software developer that wishes to move fast but still produce quality software, Swagger is an optimal choice for delivering results.</description>
