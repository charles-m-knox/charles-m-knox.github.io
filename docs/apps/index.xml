      <description>Space Codes is an app that plays custom, curated focus music to help you focus. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple app that has a few hours of songs I wrote myself, specifically to help people tune out the noise of every day life and fill their minds with simple, moving sounds.
Space Codes is under review in the app store right now, as of 3/30/2021 - I&amp;rsquo;ll post the link here soon.</description>
