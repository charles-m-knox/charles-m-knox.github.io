By default, when using Angular `routerLink` tags in your HTML, the behavior users will experience when clicking these links is that the browser keeps the current scrollbar positions, before and after clicking.

There are cases where this is undesirable, such as when using an Angular router to route URLs (such as `/home` or `/articles` ) to Angular components.

To fix this, add in your `app-routing.module.ts` file the following into the `@NgModule` imports:

```ts
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        RouterModule.forRoot(
            routes,
            {
                scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled' // https://stackoverflow.com/a/44372167
            }
        )
    ],
    exports: [RouterModule]
})
```

Credit where credit is due - this was found and validated by me, but added to Stack Overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44372167).

If you don't have an `app-routing.module.ts`, well, the file (and other Angular routing integration) is auto-generated by [Angular](https://cli.angular.io/). I've done a bit of searching on how to add routing to an existing project that didn't have it already, and in my opinion, it's potentially easier (YMMV) to just generate a new project and answer 'Yes' to adding routes when prompted, and migrate your services/components/etc.
