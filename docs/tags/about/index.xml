      <description>My name is Charles Knox. I am a professional software developer, and have nearly a decade of industry software development and information technology experience.
I enjoy writing about techie-focused topics, as well as things I learn as I pursue of a life of healthy living.
Occasionally, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and post some privacy-respecting ads or affiliate links for products or groups that I care about. I will never plug a company or corporate entity on this site that isn&amp;rsquo;t worthy.</description>
