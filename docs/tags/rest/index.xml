      <description>Swagger is a framework to enable arbitrary implementations of the OpenAPI specification.
Why? In all of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on (personal and professional), one of the more consistent problems is documentation of API endpoints, as well as agreement upon REST interaction schema between microservices. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until a few years into my software development career that I became aware of Swagger.
Swagger lets you:
 auto-generate interactive documentation for your REST API auto-generate a client to consume your defined REST API in many programming languages/frameworks auto-generate a server to host your defined REST API in many programming languages/frameworks  For the bright software developer that wishes to move fast but still produce quality software, Swagger is an optimal choice for delivering results.</description>
