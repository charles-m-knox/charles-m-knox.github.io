      <description>ðŸ’‰ Introduction A friend of mine, Tynick, and I crossed paths on a project he started - he wanted to get a COVID vaccine by doing a volunteer shift. The two websites that offer volunteering signups occasionally had openings, but they were always taken almost immediately.

      <description>The title is a bit of an exaggeration, but it&amp;rsquo;s partly true if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the correct properties in your HTML elements.
In HTML, you should be using rel=&amp;quot;noopener noreferrer&amp;quot; along with target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; in your &amp;lt;a&amp;gt; tags - if not, you run major security risks. This GitHub Pages site shows you how: https://apal21.github.io/target-blank/
Many linters will catch this if it&amp;rsquo;s not set, so make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re using a linter when you write your code.</description>
