Bob Haines supported my work on the [Firefox Containers Helper](/portfolio/webextensions/ffcontainershelper/) extension. I am honored and humbled that he took the time to make a contribution and a feature request, and as my first supporter, he will forever have my gratitude. Thank you Bob!

Thank you for the firefox-containers-helper. Your module is helping me register older senior citizens for the COVID-19 vaccine. Would love it if you could add click then shift-click selection to the addon. Thanks again for the excellent module!

Just discovered this excellent extension. Super helpful for managing large numbers of containers. I've found it extremely useful to help me book vaccine appointments for senior citizens. Thanks for this super useful module!
