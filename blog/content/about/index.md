My name is Charles Knox. I am a professional software developer,
and have nearly a decade of industry software development and
information technology experience.

I enjoy writing about techie-focused topics, as well as
things I learn as I pursue of a life of healthy living.

Occasionally, I'll try and post some privacy-respecting ads or
affiliate links for products or groups that I care about. I will never
plug a company or corporate entity on this site that isn't worthy.

If you see an advertisement that looks suspicious, please [email me](#contact) and I'll investigate.

## Blog

This blog's source code is publicly viewable and contained [here on GitHub](https://github.com/charles-m-knox/charles-m-knox.github.io).

## Contact

[ðŸ“§ Contact me via email](mailto:579af7a8-9a71-4570-a0b2-9e5ae46346a7@aleeas.com), this is the preferred method. I use a mail forwarding service for all of my public-facing email links - when you send this to me, it will go directly to my inbox.

## Privacy and data

**I do not personally collect any data about you when you visit my site.**

However, there are a few entities that may track you in different ways when you visit the site:

* **[Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)** - All requests go through Cloudflare first; it proxies all connections.
  * I can see basic geographical information about everyone who visits my site through Cloudflare.
  * I cannot (currently to my knowledge) see what pages were visited via Cloudflare.
* **[GitHub](https://github.com)** - This site is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).
  * [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) owns GitHub, so if you have any objections to Microsoft seeing that you're visiting this site, I understand, but ultimately I have decided that hosting with GitHub pages is acceptable for the vast majority of personal privacy/security threat models. You'll probably be fine.
  * Because all connections are proxied through Cloudflare, [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)/[GitHub](https://github.com) receive information about Cloudflare, but it is likely that Cloudflare may also provide `X-Forwarded-For` headers that indicate the originating IP address to GitHub, as this is fairly common.
* **Any ad networks that run through this site** will be running JavaScript that I do not have control over.
  * I will list out every ad network that runs on this site. I hope you'll trust my choice in ad networks; I scrutinize them fairly carefully before deciding to go forward with one.
  * While it is very important to me that you see the ads on this site, I understand if you have a serious privacy concern and need to avoid being tracked on the web. I rely on income for this site, so please consider disabling it if an advertising network that I've vetted does not violate your privacy threat model.
  * You should assume that arbitrary ad-driven JavaScript can uniquely fingerprint you and feed that data into anywhere; I have not inspected the source code for the ads myself, and even though the ad networks I choose assure me they do not track users, you cannot be 100% certain.
* **Any third-party CDN's** that deliver JavaScript, CSS, or other assets needed in order for your browser to run this site.
  * I don't believe my site currently leverages any third-party CDN's, but if that changes, it will likely be a standard CDN such as Amazon CloudFront, JSDelivr, or some other common CDN.

## Ads, referrals, affiliate links

As of writing this article on 2/28/2021, I am not currently promoting anything by means of affiliate programs. This *is* likely to change, but in general, my personal affiliate policy is as follows:

* I will generally not push any products I do not believe in. If I do, I will write a clear disclaimer.
* I generally try to trust a company before I would even purchase something from there myself.
  * I generally will try to apply the same scrutiny to products I recommend, with disclaimers noting any objections I have.

**You should assume that any link to any product on my site is an affiliate link**. I'll try and add disclaimers to highlight them where possible.

## List of current ad networks

* **[AdEx](https://www.adex.network/)** - *A display ad network for reduced ad fraud and increased user privacy.*
  * This site uses the [DAI stablecoin cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_(cryptocurrency)) for payment processing. As a result, you may see crypto-related advertising from time to time. Stay vigilant, and use best judgement when managing cryptocurrencies, as mistakes can get your funds taken away.
* **[ContextCue](https://contextcue.com)** - *ContextCue is a privacy-focused advertising network that allows advertisers and publishers to grow their business with fast, lightweight, contextual ads that don't track, collect, or store user data*
  * This ad network seems like it was written by regular software developers with good intentions, and written for the modern world. Consider removing ContextCue from your ad blocker globally.
  * ContextCue allows me to pick a variety of ad topics. I will pick ads topics according to the article I'm writing, so you may see e.g. finance or computer related topics. **This is not you being tracked, this is me curating advertisements according to what you're reading**.

## Ways to support me directly

If you have an ad blocker turned on, and absolutely don't want to turn it off, I understand. I don't make much money from the ads anyways, since I personally block them and I don't really like them.

Here are some ways to send me a tip:

### Buy me a coffee! ðŸ¥‘

* **[Buy me a ~~Coffee~~ healthy avocado! ðŸ¥‘ ](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/charles.m.knox)** I can't drink much coffee, but I do need to eat healthy, and avocados are expensive! ðŸ™‚
