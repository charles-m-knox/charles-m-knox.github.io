## Supporters

### Bob Haines

Bob Haines supported my work on the [Firefox Containers Helper](/portfolio/webextensions/ffcontainershelper/) extension. I am honored and humbled that he took the time to make a contribution and a feature request, and as my first supporter, he will forever have my gratitude. Thank you Bob!

Bob contributed to my healthy eating and coding habits via Buy me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/charles.m.knox
